# Custom Object Detection and Tracking using Darknet-YOLO with IOU Tracker, and Automated Traffic Management System

This project is a comprehensive solution for real-world surveillance and traffic management scenarios. It extends a custom object detection and tracking system by integrating an OCR engine for vehicle number plate recognition, automated traffic count, and speed detection.

## Overview

The project is divided into several components:

1. **Object Detection and Tracking**: Utilizes Darknet-YOLO along with an Intersection over Union (IOU) tracker for effective object detection and tracking.

2. **OCR for Number Plate Recognition**: Tracks vehicles' entry through apartment gates, identifies the number plate using OCR, and logs this information into a database, thereby automating the entire process.

3. **Automated Traffic Count**: Counts vehicles crossing a road for each class.

4. **Speed Detection**: Automatically calculates vehicle speed based on the length covered by camera angle, frames per second of the recording or camera, and distance covered in terms of pixels in the frame.
